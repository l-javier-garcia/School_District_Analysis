# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
This study was initiated due to suspicions of academic dishonety of the Thomas High School ninth grade class and what the repercussions of this would be to the district. The request was to nullify the 9th graders grades and then redo the district summary and illustrate the changes. The platform used was Pandas/Jupyter Notebook/PythonData.

## Results
<!-- Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.-->

###### How is the district summary affected?
The district summary was affected drastically, with the Thomas High School ninth graders grades taken out of the equation it brought the math score, reading score, overall scores as well as their respective percentages down considerably. The numbers were below the 47% mark. This will result in a decrease in future budgets and spending.

Thomas High Schools went from being in the median for grades down to the very bottom. It is unfortunate yet unjustified for them to falsify information for them to try and keep their funding.  

###### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Thomas High School was profiled as a mid performer compared to other educational institutions but when we remove the ninth graders it brought them down to the very bottom of the district.

######  ·How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the Math and reading scores by grade
Thomas High School students fair pretty well in 10th through 12th grade but due to the nature of our study which nullifies the 9th grade scores it's invalidated pulling them down the list. 
######  ·How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the Scores by school spending
The spending doesn't show an immediate effect but it will definitely hurt next year
######  ·How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the Scores by school size
School size was not affected much since we didn't really substract the 9th graders out of the roster.
######  ·How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the Scores by school type
It made the district schools rate lower than charter schools.
